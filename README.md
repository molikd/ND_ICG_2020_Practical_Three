ND ICG 2020 Practical Three

Practical Three for Introduction to Computational Genomics

This practical is intended to to help you get used to building genomes in Julia

Clone this repository, create your own branch (your netid) and modify the practical.sh script:

  1. Create a Julia script that creates a genome de buijn graph, this script should output a gfa. 
    - you are not allowed to hardcode filenames
    - you may use a SRA dataset of your choice (remember to Trim!)
  2. Edit practical.sh to qsub the Julia script
  3. Open the gfa in Bandage and take a screenshot
    - add the screen shot to your branch
